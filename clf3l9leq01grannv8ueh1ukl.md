Twilio is a cloud communication platform that provides APIs for developers to send and receive messages, make and receive phone calls, and more. In this blog post, we will discuss how to send a message on phone and verification code on phone with Twilio through Django with code.

### **Step 1:**

Sign Up for a Twilio Account To use Twilio, you need to sign up for an account on the Twilio website. Once you have signed up, you will get an Account SID and an Auth Token, which you will need to use in your Django code.

### **Step 2:**

Install Twilio Python Library To use Twilio with Django, you need to install the Twilio Python library. You can install it using pip:

**COPY**

```python
pip install twilio
```

### **Step 3:**

Configure Twilio Settings in Django Next, you need to configure Twilio settings in the Django [**settings.py**](http://settings.py) file. Here is an example:

**COPY**

```python
# settings.py

TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID = 'your-account-sid'
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN = 'your-auth-token'
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER = 'your-phone-number'
```

Replace `your-account-sid`, `your-auth-token`, and `your-phone-number` with your own values.

### **Step 4:**

Send a Message on Phone To send a message on a phone, you can use Twilio's Messaging API. Here is an example:

**COPY**

```python
# views.py

from django.conf import settings
from twilio.rest import Client

def send_sms(request, phone_number, message):
    client = Client(settings.TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID, settings.TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN)
    message = client.messages.create(
        body=message,
        from_=settings.TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER,
        to=phone_number
    )
```

In this example, we are defining a function `send_sms` that takes a phone number and a message as arguments. We are then creating a Twilio client object and using it to send a message to the given phone number.

### **Step 5:**

Send a Verification Code on Phone To send a verification code on a phone, you can generate a random code and send it to the user's phone using Twilio's Messaging API. Here is an example:

**COPY**

```python
# views.py

from django.conf import settings
from random import randint
from twilio.rest import Client

def send_verification_code(request, phone_number):
    verification_code = randint(1000, 9999)
    message = f'Your verification code is: {verification_code}'
    client = Client(settings.TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID, settings.TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN)
    message = client.messages.create(
        body=message,
        from_=settings.TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER,
        to=phone_number
    )
    return verification_code
```

In this example, we are defining a function `send_verification_code` that takes a phone number as an argument. We are generating a random verification code and sending it to the user's phone using Twilio's Messaging API. We are then returning the verification code so that it can be used for verification.

### **Conclusion**

Twilio provides a simple and easy-to-use API for sending messages and making phone calls. In this blog post, we discussed how to send a message on phone and verification code on phone with Twilio through Django with code. With Twilio and Django, you can easily add phone verification to your web application.

### **Introduction**

Linux is an open-source operating system that has become increasingly popular over the years, especially among programmers and IT professionals. If you are new to Linux, you may be wondering what it is and why it is so popular. In this blog, we will cover what Linux is, how to use it, its uses, commands, and why it is better than Windows for programmers.

### **What is Linux?**

Linux is an open-source operating system that was initially developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991. It is a Unix-like operating system that is based on the Linux kernel. The Linux kernel is the core component of the operating system, responsible for managing the system's resources, such as the CPU, memory, and I/O devices. The Linux kernel is released under the GNU General Public License, which means that it is free to use, modify, and distribute.

### **How to use Linux?**

Linux can be used on desktops, servers, and even on mobile devices. There are several popular Linux distributions, such as Ubuntu, Fedora, and Debian, which are available for free download. To use Linux, you will need to download the distribution of your choice and create a bootable USB drive or DVD. Once you have created the bootable media, you can boot your computer from it and follow the installation instructions.

### **What is Ubuntu?**

Ubuntu is a free and open-source Linux distribution based on Debian. It was created in 2004 by South African entrepreneur Mark Shuttleworth and his company Canonical Ltd. Ubuntu is known for its ease of use, stability, and security, making it an excellent choice for both desktops and servers.

### **How to use Ubuntu?**

Ubuntu can be used on desktops, servers, and even on mobile devices. The latest version of Ubuntu can be downloaded from the official website and installed on your computer. The installation process is straightforward and can be done in a few steps. Once you have installed Ubuntu, you can use it just like any other operating system.

Ubuntu provides a graphical user interface (GUI) that is easy to use and intuitive. The interface is similar to Windows and macOS, with a dock at the bottom of the screen and a panel at the top. Ubuntu also provides a command-line interface (CLI) that allows you to perform advanced tasks and automate repetitive tasks.

# Introduction

In the world of modern application development, efficient data storage and retrieval are paramount. MongoDB, a NoSQL database, has gained immense popularity for its flexibility, scalability, and ease of use. In this comprehensive guide, we'll walk you through the process of installing MongoDB and provide some basic code examples to get you started.

## Chapter 1: Installation of MongoDB

### A. Prerequisites

Before we dive into the installation process, let's make sure you have the necessary prerequisites:

1. **Operating System:** MongoDB supports various platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. Ensure you are using a compatible operating system.
    
2. **Package Manager (Optional):** On Linux, it's helpful to have a package manager like `apt` (for Ubuntu/Debian) or `yum` (for CentOS/RedHat) for a streamlined installation. On Windows and macOS, you can use the official MongoDB installer.
    

### B. Installation Steps

#### Windows

1. **Download the Installer:**
    
    * Visit the MongoDB Download Center ([https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)) and select the Windows version.
        
    * Download the installer and run it.
        
2. **Install MongoDB:**
    
    * Follow the installer prompts, choosing the "Complete" setup type.
        
    * MongoDB will be installed with default settings.
        
3. **Configure MongoDB as a Windows Service (Optional):**
    
    * Open a Command Prompt as an administrator.
        
    * Navigate to the MongoDB bin directory (e.g., `C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\<version>\bin`).
        
    * Run the following command to install MongoDB as a service:
        
        ```plaintext
        mongod --install --dbpath "C:\data\db"
        ```
        
    * Start the MongoDB service with:
        
        ```plaintext
        net start MongoDB
        ```
        

#### macOS

1. **Install Homebrew (Optional):**
    
    * If you don't already have Homebrew installed, open Terminal and run:
        
        ```plaintext
        /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
        ```
        
2. **Install MongoDB:**
    
    * Run the following command to install MongoDB:
        
        ```plaintext
        brew tap mongodb/brew
        brew install mongodb-community
        ```
        
3. **Start MongoDB:**
    
    * Start the MongoDB service with:
        
        ```plaintext
        brew services start mongodb/brew/mongodb-community
        ```
        

#### Linux

1. **Add MongoDB Repository:**
    
    * Add the MongoDB repository for your distribution. For example, on Ubuntu 20.04, run:
        
        ```plaintext
        sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv 9DA31620334BD75D9DCB49F368818C72E52529D4
        echo "deb [ arch=amd64,arm64 ] https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu focal/mongodb-org/5.0 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-5.0.list
        ```
        
2. **Install MongoDB:**
    
    * Update your package list and install MongoDB with the following commands:
        
        ```plaintext
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install -y mongodb-org
        ```
        
3. **Start MongoDB:**
    
    * Start MongoDB using:
        
        ```plaintext
        sudo service mongod start
        ```
        

## Chapter 2: Basic MongoDB Usage

### A. MongoDB Shell

MongoDB provides a command-line interface called the MongoDB shell (`mongo`) for interacting with the database.

1. **Start MongoDB Shell:**
    
    * Open a terminal window and run:
        
        ```plaintext
        mongo
        ```
        
2. **Create a Database:**
    
    * To create a new database, use the `use` command:
        
        ```plaintext
        use mydb
        ```
        
3. **Create a Collection:**
    
    * Collections are analogous to tables in relational databases. Create one like this:
        
        ```plaintext
        db.createCollection("mycollection")
        ```
        
4. **Insert Documents:**
    
    * Insert documents into your collection:
        
        ```plaintext
        db.mycollection.insert({ name: "John", age: 30 })
        db.mycollection.insert({ name: "Jane", age: 25 })
        ```
        
5. **Query Documents:**
    
    * Retrieve documents using queries:
        
        ```plaintext
        db.mycollection.find({ age: { $gte: 28 } })
        ```
        

### B. MongoDB with Node.js

MongoDB can be easily integrated into Node.js applications using the official MongoDB Node.js driver.

1. **Install the MongoDB Node.js Driver:**
    
    * In your Node.js project directory, run:
        
        ```plaintext
        npm install mongodb
        ```
        
2. **Connect to MongoDB:**
    
    * Use the following code to connect to your MongoDB server:
        
        ```javascript
        const { MongoClient } = require("mongodb");
        
        const uri = "mongodb://localhost:27017";
        const client = new MongoClient(uri, { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true });
        
        async function connect() {
          try {
            await client.connect();
            console.log("Connected to MongoDB");
          } catch (err) {
            console.error(err);
          }
        }
        
        connect();
        ```
        
3. **Perform CRUD Operations:**
    
    * You can now perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using the MongoDB Node.js driver.
        

## Chapter 3: Basic CRUD Queries

MongoDB provides an extensive set of operations for Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations.

### A. Create (Insert) Documents

Learn how to insert data into MongoDB collections using `insertOne()` and `insertMany()`.

### B. Read (Retrieve) Documents

Explore various methods for retrieving documents:

* `find()`: Query documents based on specific criteria.
    
* `findOne()`: Retrieve a single document that matches the query.
    
* `count()`: Count documents that match a query.
    
* `distinct()`: Find unique values within a field.
    
* Projection: Control which fields are returned.
    

### C. Update Documents

Discover methods for updating documents:

* `updateOne()` and `updateMany()`: Modify a single or multiple documents.
    
* `$set`, `$unset`, `$inc`, and more: Update specific fields within documents.
    

### D. Delete Documents

Learn how to delete documents using `deleteOne()` and `deleteMany()`.

## Chapter 4: Advanced Query Operators

MongoDB offers a rich set of query operators to perform advanced queries.

### A. Comparison Operators

Use operators like `$eq`, `$ne`, `$gt`, `$lt`, `$gte`, and `$lte` for comparison-based queries.

### B. Logical Operators

Combine conditions with `$and`, `$or`, and `$not` to create complex queries.

### C. Array Operators

Query arrays using `$in`, `$nin`, `$all`, `$elemMatch`, and more.

### D. Element Operators

Check for the existence of fields with `$exists` and null values with `$type`.

## Chapter 5: Aggregation Framework

MongoDB's Aggregation Framework enables complex data transformations and analysis.

### A. `$match` Stage

Filter documents that meet specific criteria.

### B. `$group` Stage

Group documents by specified fields and perform aggregation operations like `$sum`, `$avg`, and `$max`.

### C. `$project` Stage

Shape the output documents by specifying which fields to include, rename, or exclude.

### D. `$sort` and `$limit` Stages

Sort documents and limit the result set.

### E. `$lookup` Stage

Perform left outer joins between two collections.

## Chapter 6: Text Search

Learn how to perform full-text searches in MongoDB.

### A. Text Indexing

Create a text index on fields to enable text search.

### B. `$text` Operator

Perform text searches using `$text` queries, which include `$search`, `$caseSensitive`, and `$diacriticSensitive` options.

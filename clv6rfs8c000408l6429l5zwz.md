At blogsbymayank, we aim to provide a satisfactory experience to all our users. However, we understand that you may need to cancel or request a refund for our services under certain circumstances. This Cancellation & Refund Policy outlines the terms and conditions for requesting a cancellation or refund.

## Cancellation Policy

You may cancel your subscription or account with blogsbymayank at any time by contacting our customer support team at [mayankdatabase04@gmail.com](mailto:mayankdatabase04@gmail.com) or through the cancellation process provided in your account settings.

Upon cancellation, your access to our paid services or premium features will be terminated immediately, and your account will be downgraded to the free version, if available.

## Refund Policy

We offer a 14-day money-back guarantee for all new subscriptions or one-time purchases made on our website. If you are not satisfied with our services within the first 14 days of your purchase, you may request a full refund.

To request a refund, please contact our customer support team at [mayankdatabase04@gmail.com](mailto:mayankdatabase04@gmail.com) within 14 days of your purchase date, providing your order details and the reason for your refund request.

Refunds will be processed within 5-7 business days and credited back to the original payment method used for the purchase.

Please note that refunds are not available for the following:

* Cancellations or refund requests made after the 14-day money-back guarantee period.
    
* Subscription renewals or recurring payments after the initial 14-day period.
    
* Partial refunds for unused portions of a subscription or service.
    

## Exceptions and Limitations

We reserve the right to refuse or delay a refund request if we suspect fraudulent activity, abuse, or violation of our terms of service.

In the event of a technical issue or error on our part, we may offer a refund or extension of service on a case-by-case basis.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Cancellation & Refund Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We encourage you to review this policy periodically for the latest information.

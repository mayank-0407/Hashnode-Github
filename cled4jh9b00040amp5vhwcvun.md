# Why did I Choose Django for web dev?

Whenever we think of creating some projects for our college for internships. We think of learning web development or android development. But we don't know how and from which language should we start. So here is my view on this.

Web development is an essential part of building modern-day applications, and choosing the right web framework can be a challenging task. In my experience, Django has proven to be the best choice for building web applications. In this article, I will share my reasons for choosing Django for web development.

* Rapid Development
    

Django is a high-level Python web framework that comes with numerous pre-built components and libraries, making it easy for developers to build web applications faster. With Django, you can quickly create a database schema, integrate authentication, and create a web admin interface for managing the application's data.

* Scalability
    

Django is designed to handle large-scale applications with a vast user base. The framework follows a modular design approach, which allows you to add or remove modules as per the requirement, making the application more scalable. Django's ORM (Object Relational Mapper) helps in managing the database schema, making it easy to scale the application as the requirements change.

* Security
    

Django provides robust security features to protect web applications from vulnerabilities and attacks. Django comes with built-in protection against SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF), and clickjacking attacks. Additionally, Django also provides built-in support for SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption, making it easy to secure the web application's communication.

* Versatility
    

Django is a versatile web framework that can be used for developing a wide range of web applications, from simple web applications to complex ones. Django's flexibility and scalability make it easy to develop applications with different requirements, such as eCommerce applications, social media platforms, content management systems, and more.

* Large Community and Ecosystem
    

Django has a vast and active community that contributes to its development, maintenance, and improvement. The community provides numerous resources, such as documentation, tutorials, and forums, making it easy for developers to learn and solve problems. Additionally, Django has a large ecosystem of third-party packages, making it easy to extend the functionality of the framework and enhance the application's features.

In conclusion, Django is an excellent choice for web development due to its rapid development, scalability, security, versatility, and active community. If you're looking for a web framework to build your next application, consider giving Django a try.
